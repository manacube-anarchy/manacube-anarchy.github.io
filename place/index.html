    <h2>Important Information about the /place event</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> You can do /toggle to disable the double click to place block feature, or to turn it back on</li>
        <li> You can do /store to buy more blocks </li>
        <li> One (1) Cubit is approximately equal to one (1) American Dollar (~ 0.90 Euros)</li>
        <li> One block is anywhere from 11 to 17 cents to buy</li>
        <li> "First to type" and "First to unscramble" challenges pop up around once a minute. Winning will give one block. </li>
        <li> A Mana Fairy will spawn every fifteen minutes. Finding it and clicking it will give up to 15 blocks. (Note: You have to be one of the first five people to find it)</li>
        <li> Unless you buy blocks, find the Mana Fairy, win the challenges, or buy a rank, there is a 60 second cooldown between placing blocks.</li>
        <li> You can buy ranks to decrease the cooldown for placing blocks. </li>
